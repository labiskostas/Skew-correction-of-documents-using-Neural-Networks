# Skew-correction-of-documents-using-Neural-Networks
#I developed a Neural Network that detects and corrects the skewness of digital documents. 
#Firstly I developed a code in Python in order to make my own data. Specifically to train the neural networks I used ScriptNetHistoricalWI 2017 dataset.
#I skewed the images in random degrees and saved them in my Google drive along with the torsion degrees in a list in order to have them as ground truth. 
#I developed a Convolutional Neural Network(CNNs) from scratch in order to automatically recognize skewed images and the degrees they are skewed. 
#In addition I have analyzed some well known networks(VGG16,Resnet-50,Mobile-Net) and used them in order to compare their results with mine.
